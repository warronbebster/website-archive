            <p>Climate change is actively transforming our world.</p>
            <p>By the time the next century rolls in, the sea level could be two meters higher than it is today. What does that mean for you? Well, many of the waterfronts you know and love may no longer exist. New York will need anti-flooding measures to avoid catostrophic damage, Florida could see the ocean encroach as much as 5 miles, and Venice is already suffering property loss. Beautiful beaches all over the world will be slowly encroached by rising waters, leaving culture, homes, and billions of dollars of property underwater.</p>
            <p>Additionally, changing temperatures will affect everything from vegetation to crop viability. Swaths of cold countryside will become more fertile farmland, whereas drier areas like California will only become more arid and desertlike.</p>
            <p>We will find you currently undesirable and overlooked property, which will grow in value while other properties become uninhabitable. What was once undesirable will become first-class property. We specialize in future waterfront property and areas with sufficient water supplies, desirable climates, and little storm activity. Get a free consultation to determine whether or not your family and home will be in danger. We begin taking public clients on January 13th. Email <a href="mailto:hello@highertidesrealty.com">hello@highertidesrealty.com</a> to start the process.</p>

            <p>What can we do for you?</p>
            <p>Property advising and consultations.</p>
            <p>Our property utility is a free service to help property owners gauge the potential loss of property value due to rising sea levels over the next century. We hold that helping people be informed about their risk is our social responsibility.</p>
            <p>We also provide consultation for property owners looking for post-climate change property. Real estate that will grow in value as tempuratures and sea levels rise is currently in abundance, and makes for an ideal long-term investment.
