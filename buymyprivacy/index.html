        <h1>Hello, and welcome to buymyprivacy.com!</h1>
        <p>Buy my privacy is a series of products generated from “semi-private” information that is not generally publicized, but is nonetheless not private in the purest sense; as it is sent to and used by organizations who built the software we use. This information is turned for a profit by selling our “private” habits to advertisers.</p>

    <div class="contain text" id="about">
        <p>These data are generated by algorithm, for algorithm. They are sent back and forth as JSON objects, unix epoch dates, and other formats; but the habits they reflect are deeply human, albeit mediated by our keys, mice, and thumbs. They contain our habits, our thoughts, our movements, our little eccentricities, and if we do a bit of deciphering, much, much more- our relationships, our occupations, our passions, our goals. This wealth of human information can also be ours to do with what we wish. To demonstrate this, I (<a href="http://barronwebster.com">Barron</a>) have begun to sell my “semi-private” information to other humans to decipher and learn about me as a human. This information is not just a data point in a banner ad targeting algorithm.</p>
