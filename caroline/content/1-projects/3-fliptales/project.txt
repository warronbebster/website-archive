A selection of illustration work done for the RPG board game, FlipTales. "In FlipTales, you and your friends pretend to be different magical characters in a story, working together to advance the plot. It's like Mad-Libs meets Choose-Your-Own-Adventure.
Designer Ryan Mather and I developed FlipTales to bring more accessibility and inclusivity to the Dungeons & Dragons genre by focusing on simple design, light-hearted voice, and gender-neutral content." Check out the Kickstarter at (link: kck.st/2RR9zAS text: kck.st/2RR9zAS)
