        <h2>The problem.</h2>
        <div class="bucket_text left">
            <p>Programming is currently extremely inaccessible.</p>
            <p>As the world becomes more mobile-dependent, the gulf between programmers and users is set to become even wider. Even for apps with simple functionality, the ability to create is limited to the trained developers who make and publish applications. Meanwhile, the app goldrush is in full swing, with both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store boasting millions of apps and rising, making discovery increasingly difficult.</p>

        <h2>Let people define their own programs.</h2>
        <div class="bucket_text left">
            <p>We should be able to define what we want out of technology without resorting to cryptic code. We should be able to tell computers what we want them to do, in the ways that we know how. Big Talk is a way for people to make their own programs – to use the computer in their pocket to its fullest potential.</p>

        <h2>Don’t code the how. Define the what.</h2>
        <div class="bucket_text left">
            <p>Why spend hours wrangling code when you already know what you want your device to do? Big Talk lets you design programs for your life by defining Goals.</p>
            <p>Goals let Big Talk know what you want out of a program. Using highly advanced machine learning techniques, Big Talk will help you in finding a program that fits your needs.</p>
            <p>Big Talk functions map inputs to outputs: for example, when the phone receives a shake input, it calls a friend. Goals are created by relating known inputs to known outputs. Inputs and outputs are set using primitives - think of them as objects, or sets of information.</p>
            <p>Once you give your goals to Big Talk, it gives you back a function which fits your specification. If it doesn’t look right to you, simply tell Big Talk what isn’t working, or make a few more goals. The more precise the inputs and outputs, the faster the system can learn.</p>

        <h2>Find your way with Guides.</h2>
        <div class="bucket_text left">
            <p>Guides provide an easy way to navigate Big Talk. Guides can contain many features, such as function discovery, accepted functions, collaborative functions development, domain-specific primitives, and custom search interfaces.</p>
            <p>Guides can be thought of as specialized clients for Big Talk, adding useful functionality for a specific domain. Anyone can make and share a guide.</p>
